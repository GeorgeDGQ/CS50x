Jorge Daniel Gómez Quintana "Songs"

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A listener's aura, which is calculated by averaging aural characteristics (such as valence, energy, etc.) from their top 100 songs, may indicate a primarily positive, uplifting, and energetic profile.  However, since energetic songs predominate the averages, this could obscure subtle preferences.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
The major flaw in this method is that the frequency of playback is ignored by giving all songs the same weight; a song that is played fifty times should have more weight than one that is only played once. Instead, it would be better to weight the qualities according to the actual number of plays. In addition, if date and time data are available, temporal patterns suggesting dynamic mood transitions, such as lively mornings versus acoustic evenings, can be examined.
